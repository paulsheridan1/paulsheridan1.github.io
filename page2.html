            <p>Bullying usually involves three individuals or groups: the bully, the victim and the bystander. Bullying is repeated, aggressive
behaviour towards one person from another person or group of people and it is hurtful. It might be shoving, name-calling,
shunning, lunch-stealing or even gossiping.
You may think that as long as you're not the bully you're not hurting anyone, but that's not true the bystander plays an important
role in a bullying situation. </p>

            <h2>Why Does Bullying Happen?</h2>
            <div class="dots">
                <p>. . .</p>
            </div>
<p>Bullying behaviour can arise from distrust, fear, misunderstanding, lack of knowledge or jealousy - all factors that schools can address in positive and proactive ways.

Bullying can also happen because the student gets a reaction they like. This is where teaching students ways to effectively respond to bullying behaviour is helpful.

The following profiles of students who are more likely to be bullied and those who more like to bully others are based on patterns found in Australian research; the profiles do not mean all students with these characteristics will be involved in bullying.</p>

            <h2>How Could This Affect You?</h2>
            <div class="dots">
                <p>. . .</p>
            </div>
<p>Everyone reacts to bullying in different ways. You may feel sad, angry, anxious, worried or scared. You may have difficulty sleeping, or may not feel like eating or hanging out with friends. You may even feel that you do not want to go to school anymore.

Whatever the case, if you feel that something is wrong, you should check the matter out with someone you can help you</p>
